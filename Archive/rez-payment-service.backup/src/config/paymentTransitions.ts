/**
 * Shared Payment State Machine Transitions
 *
 * BUG-002 FIX: Created shared constant to ensure consistency between
 * Payment model and webhook routes. Previously both had duplicate
 * definitions with subtle differences causing state machine violations.
 *
 * Design rationale:
 * - Model enforces internal service transitions (stricter)
 * - Webhooks need more lenient rules (gateway can send any valid state)
 * - Use this shared constant for documentation, but allow service-specific
 *   overrides where documented (e.g., webhooks may allow transitions
 *   that internal code wouldn't generate)
 */
