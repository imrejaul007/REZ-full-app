/**
 * Lost Coins Recovery Worker — F-01 CRITICAL FIX
 *
 * PROBLEM: In capturePayment() and handleWebhookCaptured(), the MongoDB flag
 * `walletCredited=true` is set inside a MongoDB transaction, then the transaction
 * commits, then creditWalletAfterPayment() is called to enqueue a BullMQ job.
 * If the BullMQ enqueue fails (Redis down, queue error), coins are permanently
 * lost — walletCredited=true persists in DB but no credit was ever issued. The
 * $ne:true guard on subsequent replays blocks re-credit permanently.
 *
 * SOLUTION: This worker periodically scans for stuck states and re-enqueues credits.
 *
 * SCAN LOGIC:
 *   Find payments where:
 *     status = 'completed'
 *     walletCredited = true
 *     walletCreditRecoveryAttempted = false
 *     completedAt > now - 24 hours  (only recent payments)
 *
 *   For each stuck payment:
 *     1. Check Redis key `pay-credit-queued:<paymentId>`
 *        - 'enqueued' → job was queued successfully, skip
 *        - 'pending'  → enqueue in progress when Redis went down, re-enqueue
 *        - 'failed'   → enqueue definitely failed, re-enqueue
 *        - absent     → Redis was down when creditWalletAfterPayment ran, re-enqueue
 *     2. Call creditWalletAfterPayment() — BullMQ idempotency key prevents double-credit
 *     3. Mark walletCreditRecoveryAttempted = true (prevents infinite loops)
 *
 *   Additionally: for payments where:
 *     walletCredited = true
 *     walletCreditRecoveryAttempted = true
 *     walletCreditRecoveryAt > now - 7 days
 *   The worker checks if the CoinTransaction was actually created (via wallet service API
 *   or by querying the CoinTransaction collection). If not, re-attempt.
 *
 * SCHEDULE: Runs every 5 minutes via setInterval.
 * CONCURRENCY: Processes one batch of 50 at a time to avoid hammering Redis/MongoDB.
 * SAFETY: Max 3 recovery attempts per payment (tracked in walletCreditRecoveryAt + count).
